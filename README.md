# Network-Analysis-of-Real-World-Graphs
This repository contains a comprehensive network analysis of real-world datasets. Using Python and R, the project explores properties like adjacency matrices, network density, centrality measures, and bipartite graphs. Visualizations and metrics such as degree distribution, clustering coefficients, and shortest path lengths provide insights into network structure and behavior.

Project Objectives

1. Graph Representation: Generate adjacency matrices for network representation.

2. Network Properties: Compute density, degree distributions, clustering coefficients, and shortest path lengths.

3. Network Analysis: Identify centrality measures (degree, closeness, and betweenness).
   Evaluate cyclic and acyclic structures.

4. Visualization: Create visual representations of graphs to highlight key insights.

5. Application: Apply analyses to real-world networks such as social, biological, and technological graphs.

Key Findings

Network Properties: Identified dense clusters and sparse regions within networks.
                    Highlighted key nodes driving connectivity and influence.

Insights from Centrality: Degree and betweenness centrality revealed critical nodes in network structure.

Bipartite Graphs: Provided meaningful insights into relationships between two distinct groups.
